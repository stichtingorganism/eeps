Abstract
========



EEP Comments
============

Comments from the community on the EEP should occur on the comment fields of the pull requests in
any open EEPs. Editors will use these sources to judge rough consensus. 


EEP licensing
=============

New EEPs may be accepted with the following licenses. Each new EEP MUST
identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Each license
MUST be referenced by their respective abbreviation given below.

For example, a preamble might include the following License header::

  License: BSD-2-Clause
           GNU-All-Permissive

In this case, the EEP text is fully licensed under both the OSI-approved
BSD 2-clause license as well as the GNU All-Permissive License, and
anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with
the terms of *either* license. In other words, the license list is an
"OR choice", not an "AND also" requirement.

It is also possible to license source code differently from the EEP
text. This case SHOULD be indicated in the Reference Implementation
section of the EEP. Again, each license MUST be referenced by its
respective abbreviation given below.

Statements of code licenses in EEPs are only advisory; anyone intending
to use the code should look for license statements in the code itself.

EEPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved
terms, and MAY also be licensed under unacceptable licenses
*in addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the
acceptable license(s) should be listed in the License header.

Recommended licenses
--------------------

* MIT: `Expat/MIT/X11 license <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`__
* BSD-2-Clause: `OSI-approved BSD 2-clause
  license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause>`__
* BSD-3-Clause: `OSI-approved BSD 3-clause
  license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__
* CC0-1.0: `Creative Commons CC0 1.0
  Universal <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>`__
* GNU-All-Permissive: `GNU All-Permissive
  License <http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html>`__
* Apache-2.0: `Apache License, version
  2.0 <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`__

In addition, it is RECOMMENDED that literal code included in the EEP be
dual-licensed under the same license terms as the project it modifies.
For example, literal code intended for darwin would ideally be
dual-licensed under the MIT license terms as well as one of the above
with the rest of the EEP text.

Not acceptable licenses
-----------------------

All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not
acceptable terms for a Euka Evolution Proposal.

Rationale
---------

Bitcoin's BIP 1 allowed the Open Publication License or releasing into
the public domain; was this insufficient?

* The OPL is generally regarded as obsolete, and not a license suitable
  for new publications.
* The OPL license terms allowed for the author to prevent publication
  and derived works, which was widely considered inappropriate.
* In some jurisdictions, releasing a work to the public domain is not
  recognised as a legitimate legal action, leaving the EEP simply
  copyrighted with no redistribution or modification allowed at all.

Why are there software licenses included?

* Some EEPs, especially in the Consensus category, may include literal
  code in the EEP itself which may not be available under the exact
  license terms of the EEP.
* Despite this, not all software licenses would be acceptable for
  content included in EEPs.
